# Web Scraping

-  Web scraping or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.
-  It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

-  This repository contains three python notebooks:
  1)  practicing-scraping.ipynb - This is my solution to the [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/web-scraping/index.php) web scraping exercise.
  2)  scraping-tech-track-top-100-companies - This is scraping the [Tech Track top 100 companies](http://www.fasttrack.co.uk/league-tables/tech-track-100/league-table/). This is based off an amazing web scraping tutorial on [Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-skills-web-scraping-using-python-d1a85ef607ed) by Kerry Parker.
  3)  scraping-indeed-data-scientists.ipynb - This involves scraping indeed.com to find out whether MapReduce or Spark is more in demand for the position of data scientist. This is a part of a tutorial by [Jesse Steinweg-Woods](https://jessesw.com/Data-Science-Skills/)
